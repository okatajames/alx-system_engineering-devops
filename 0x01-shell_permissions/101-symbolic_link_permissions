This script uses the ls command to get a list of all files and directories in the current working directory, and then loops through each file or directory using a for loop. For each file or directory, it uses the sudo chown and sudo chgrp commands to change the owner and group owner, respectively. Finally, it prints a message indicating that the ownership change has completed.
